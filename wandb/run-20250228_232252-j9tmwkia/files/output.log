[34m[1mwandb[0m: [33mWARNING[0m WandbCallback is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the WandbMetricsLogger, WandbModelCheckpoint, and WandbEvalCallback callbacks instead. See https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/keras for more information.
[34m[1mwandb[0m: [33mWARNING[0m The save_model argument by default saves the model in the HDF5 format that cannot save custom objects like subclassed models and custom layers. This behavior will be deprecated in a future release in favor of the SavedModel format. Meanwhile, the HDF5 model is saved as W&B files and the SavedModel as W&B Artifacts.
